## Fossils for Africa
This book explores Africa's incredibly rich fossil heritage and shows the importance of these fossils in unravelling the history of life on Earth. Africa is known as the cradle of humankind, but in terms of geological time, the emergence of humans is a relatively recent event. Right here in Africa we have evidence of the earliest traces of life, dating to about 3.8 billion years, when life on Earth was still single-celled and microbial. From these humble beginning Africa's fossil record shows how life because increasingly complex and diversified into a wide array of forms.

Dedicated chapters focus on the evolution of plants, insects and the radiation of reptiles and mammals. The book concludes with the five mass extinction events that rocked Earth's biodiversity and ponders the current crisis facing our planet’s biodiversity.


## Famous Dinosaurs of Africa
Although African dinosaurs make a significant contribution to palaeontology, they are often omitted from books in favour of better-known species like T. Rex. But their fossils have been discovered across the continent - from the Sahara Desert and the dusty plains of Kenya and Tanzania to the sandstone flats of the Karoo - and they are no less magnificent or fascinating than their 'celebrity' cousins. Famous Dinosaurs of Africa is written for children but has broad appeal for anyone interested in learning more about dinosaurs. A brief general introduction is followed by short chapters on dinosaur species, among them those that were fish-eating, sociable, predatory, etc, as well as those that were cannibals, and the biggest meat-eating dinosaur of all time - the thread being that they all come from Africa. Details are given about where they were found, the meaning of their scientific names, and their size and diet. Spectacular, colourful illustrations bring the creatures vividly to life; photographs, maps and line drawings further illustrate the subject, while 'Unsolved' and 'Up close' panels add to the intrigue.
